      <h3>Bauhaus Inspiration Image</h3>
      <p>
        This painting got my attention right away because
         of the beautiful colors and simple shapes.

    <h3>My Process</h3>
      <p> 
        I started by attempting to recreate the most basic forms 
        in the painting. I chose to use the entire rectangle canvas 
        instead of the original square shape. I also chose to use
        my favorite shade of purple, which is close to the purple 
        in the original painting, but not quite. 
  
        Once I had the base in place, I knew I wanted to add 
        interactivity to change the base into something new 
        entirely.
  
        I thought it would be fun to layer small shapes on top
        of the base in the same color palette to mimic some of 
        the imperfections in the original painting. I liked the 
        idea of using primitive shapes in keeping with the Bauhaus
        theme. I used transparency, as to not cover the base 
        completely. I chose to make the purple less transparent than the other colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ran into many issues while I was coding this up and went 
        through several iterations. 
        </p><ul>
          <li>
            Speed of transformation: First I tried using a timer and millis() 
            function to control the speed. Later I found that the for loop 
            slowed it down enough.   
          </li>
          <li>
            The mouseClick Function: At first I couldn’t wrap my head around 
            how to use it, so I opted for mouseIsPressed instead. A boolean 
            value in conjunction with an if statement was a useful way to 
            control the transformation. This meant the user had to hold down 
            the mouse while the transformation took place. In the end, I 
            decided it was better to use mouseClicked function. Click once 
            to make it transform, and click again to make it stop. It felt 
            better to give the user more control, and wasn’t hard to implement.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mouseClicked fires regardless of mouse position -- on or 
            off the canvas. I was reading through the documentation and found
            mousePressed used canvas dot notation, to identify if the mouse
            was pressed while on the canvas. I used the same idea for mouseClicked
            and it worked!
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping the base drawing: At first I had the base drawing in the 
            draw() function. When I tried to run my code, it was drawing over 
            my shapes! I decided to put the code for the base drawing into 
            the setup() function, since I only wanted it to run once.
          </li>
          <li>Using Translate for shape origins: At first I was using multiple
            translate functions for each shape. I was noticing strange patterns
            in my artwork, and then I remembered what Alex said regarding 
            multiple translates causing this very issue. I added in push() 
            and pop() to get that under control which seemed to work.
          </li>
          <li>
            I wanted the colors and shape sizes to be random, so I created
            variables that could be manipulated to accomplish the task. I 
            opted to use an array for the colors, since there was a finite 
            number of colors I wanted to use in this artwork.
          </li>          
          <li>
            I wanted to have the ability to clear the transformation. I found 
            the clear function and realized I would need to redraw the 
            base drawing after clearing the canvas. I moved the baseDraw into 
            it's own function so it could be easily called. I then added some
            functionality to the keyPressed function to clear the canvas and 
            redraw the base drawing!
          </li>  
        </ul>
