      <h2>My Process</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of a birthday e-card came to me in Week 5. In Week 5 we learned
        functions and as I was playing around with the informal exercise, the
        color palette reminded me of balloons and sparked the idea of a Birthday
        e-card.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came to this class with a background in programming but very limited
        experience in Web programming. I had a basic understanding of JSON
        files, but did not know how to use them. When it came time to do this
        final project, I really wanted to incorporate a JSON data file and get
        more comfortable in that world.
      </p>
      <p>Creating this project was quite a journey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I started with my Assignment 3, which was kind of a prototype of what
          I thought the final project might look like.
        </li>
        <li>
          I decided to use small squares as confetti instead of circles as
          balloons.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the early iterations of the project, the confetti was filling the
          screen and covering the message, so I started to think about creating
          start/sop functionality, as I used in Assignment 1, to stop the confetti when
          it reached a certain point.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next stage was trying to figure out how I wanted the confetti to
          look.
          <ul>
            <li>Did I want it to appear randomly?</li>
            <li>Did I want it start at the top and fall downwards?</li>
            <li>
              How would I handle the objects when they hit the bottom of the
              screen?
            </li>

            <li>
              I should figure out how to remove them to control the size of the
              array and minimize processing errors.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I spent some time watching our friend at
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyG_2AdHlzY"
            >The Coding Train
          </a>
          to remind me how to remove objects from an array of objects. He showed
          an example where he created a trail of ellipses (call out to Alex
          here, as I of course remembered Alex had shown us something similar in
          the earlier classes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Ultimately, I decided to go with creating the confetti in random
          locations and then remove (splice) confetti objects from the beginning 
          of the array. I was hoping it would give a twinkling effect, which it 
          did! Finding the right ratio of adding/removing confetti objects
          was key and I used that calculation in my code.
        </li>
        <li>
          I knew early on that I wanted to use JSON and create a data file to
          hold values. It took several iterations to decide what types of data I
          wanted to use and what should be stored there. In the end, I decided
          to store values for the look and feel of each background choice/theme.
        </li>
        <li>
          I decided the JSON file should contain the urls for images and mp3s. 
          It should also control the number, size and colors of the 
          confetti, which can be unique to each theme. I also added in text 
          look and feel content as each theme may have it’s own vibe.
        </li>
        <li>
          I coded the .js file in such a way that it will be able to handle
          added and/or removed objects to the JSON file seamlessly.
        </li>
        <li>
          The journey of loading the JSON file and learning to use that data was
          filled with many trial and error iterations. I finally landed on
          something that made sense to me and actually got the job done!
        </li>
        <li>
          The sound files where a little tricky. At first I was running the play
          sound in the draw loop which caused sounds no person should ever have
          to hear. Eventually, I was able to work out how to make that work.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next problem I encountered had to do with the name and drop down
          choices. At first the user could change the choice without clearing
          the screen which caused some odd results. I also had an issue where I
          was creating the buttons multiple times. I solved the issue through
          disabling the user input after they made their selections and by using
          a clearCanvas() function where I remove the buttons and rerun the set
          up() function. Similar to what I did in Assignment 1, just more
          complex.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next thing I wanted to do was give the user the ability to play
          and pause the sound. I created a button to give them control and had
          to code to handle that in all scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final piece was look and feel. I spent some time deciding how I
          wanted the user input objects to look. I made sure the “Sound on/ 
          Sound Off” button did not appear until the canvas was loaded. I 
          learned how to add classes to the DOM objects I created in order 
          to control the look and feel through CSS.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> If I had additional time to work on this project, I would spend 
        time adding more themes. I would consider adding a text box where 
        the user could control the entire message, and not be limited to
        "Happy Birthday". Eventually, I would like to learn how to make it
        more like modern e-cards today, where you can create and send to
        a friend or loved one.
      </p>

      <p>I learned a ton doing this project. Thank you for an amazing class!</p>
