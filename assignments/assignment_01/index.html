      <h3>Bauhaus Inspiration Image</h3>
      <p>
        This painting got my attention right away because
         of the beautiful colors and simple shapes.

    <h3>My Process</h3>
      <p> 
        I started by attempting to recreate the most basic forms 
        in the painting. I chose to use the entire rectangle canvas 
        instead of the original square shape. I also chose to use
        my favorite shade of purple, which is close to the purple 
        in the original painting, but not quite. 
  
        Once I had the base in place, I knew I wanted to add 
        interactivity to change the base into something new 
        entirely.
  
        I thought it would be fun to layer small shapes on top
        of the base in the same color palette to mimic some of 
        the imperfections in the original painting. I liked the 
        idea of using primitive shapes in keeping with the Bauhaus
        theme. I used transparency, as to not cover the base 
        completely. I chose to make the purple less transparent than the other colors.
      </p>

        I ran into many issues while I was coding this up and went 
        through several iterations. 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Speed of transformation: First I tried using a timer and <code>millis()</code>
            function to control the speed. Later I found that the for loop 
            slowed it down enough.   
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>mouseClick()</code> Function: At first I couldn’t wrap my head around 
            how to use it, so I opted for <code>mouseIsPressed()</code>instead. A boolean 
            value in conjunction with an if statement was a useful way to 
            control the transformation. This meant the user had to hold down 
            the mouse while the transformation took place. In the end, I 
            decided it was better to use <code>mouseClicked()</code> function. Click once 
            to make it transform, and click again to make it stop. It felt 
            better to give the user more control, and wasn’t hard to implement.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <code>mouseClicked()</code> fires regardless of mouse position -- on or 
            off the canvas. I was reading through the documentation and found
            mousePressed used canvas dot notation, to identify if the mouse
            was pressed while on the canvas. I used the same idea for mouseClicked
            and it worked!
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping the base drawing: At first I had the base drawing in the 
            draw function. When I tried to run my code, it was drawing over 
            my shapes! I decided to put the code for the base drawing into 
            the setup function, since I only wanted it to run once.
          </li>
          <li>Using <code>translate()</code> for shape origins: At first I was using multiple
            translate functions for each shape. I was noticing strange patterns
            in my artwork, and then I remembered what Alex said regarding 
            multiple translates causing this very issue. I added in <code>push()</code>
            and <code>pop()</code> to get that under control which seemed to work.
          </li>
          <li>
            I wanted the colors and shape sizes to be random, so I created
            variables that could be manipulated to accomplish the task. I 
            opted to use an array for the colors, since there was a finite 
            number of colors I wanted to use in this artwork.
          </li>          
          <li>
            I wanted to have the ability to clear the transformation. I found 
            the clear function and realized I would need to redraw the 
            base drawing after clearing the canvas. I moved the <code>baseDraw ()</code>into 
            it's own function so it could be easily called. I then added some
            functionality to the <code>keyPressed()</code> function to clear the canvas and 
            redraw the base drawing!
          </li>
